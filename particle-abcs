A is for amplitude, which is complex.
In a quantum field it will bend and flex.

B is for boson, which can be gauge.
Is the graviton one? ... Oh, just turn the page!

C is for charge, which is always conserved.
It's why neutrons fly straight, and protons fly curved.

D is for delta, a big baryon.
It was just here, but now it's gone.

E's for electron, part of an atom.
They can't match spins. Nature won't let 'em.

F is for fermions, which can't be twins.
Thus electrons get shells. Thus matter begins.

G is for gauge, a symmetrical art.
A differentiable manifold Lies at their heart.

H is for hadron, a thing of quarks and gluons.
Color's confined, so you'll never see blue ones.

L is for lepton, in three generations.
If you ask "Why three?" you'll get ruminations.
